  "content": "<p>Regarding the hype of the series <em>Sin querer queriendo</em> on HBO, we take the opportunity to recommend the author's best novel. With AI assistance, we generated a version of Jack Vettriano's work <em>Billy Boys</em>, in a parodic key of the famous cover by Anagrama publishing house for <em>The Savage Detectives</em> (Anagrama, 1998). Visceral realism bathes in a Mexican coast.</p><blockquote><p>\"I have been cordially invited to be part of visceral realism. Of course, I have accepted. There was no initiation ceremony. Better that way.\" (1998)</p></blockquote><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dx98vnos1/image/upload/v1750275121/marcapagina.page-Ravensburger-Jack-Vettriano-Billy-Boys_lw5xoz.png\" alt=\"The Wild Grasshoppers - Image 1\" class=\"w-full my-6 rounded-lg\" />",
